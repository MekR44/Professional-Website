      I am a recently retired business professional who had the <span class="strike-through">misfortune</span> privilege of reaching that milestone during the infamous pandemic of 2020 &ndash; (Insert end date here).
      <br><br>
      Although this has given me ample time to plan my post-retirement world travel, I also try to keep busy with, among other things, writing, consulting, and mentoring. Stick around and take a look at some of my endeavors!

        The english language is an excellent tool to record the eccentricities of the world that we inhabit. To that end, I write about the world from my perspective, highlighting the humor inherent in our daily lives and work places.

    <h3>Professional Expertise</h3>

    <!-----Copy/Content---->
    <p>
      I am a 40 year veteran of the tech industry and first found my feet there when first generation computers were in vogue (to be found these days, in museums!).
    </p>

    <p>
      In these years, I have guided the growth of several companies, including a start-up that I cofounded, through several eras of information processing and technology&mdash;from mainframes, client-servers, and web based solutions, to today's all-mobile offerings.
    </p>
    <p>
      My journey has taken me to multiple continents, leading global teams and executing projects for international customers. I have worn many hats and worked with people from all walks of life. 
    </p>
    <p>
      In turn, this has brought me expertise in wide-ranging aspects of the business world, with a special focus on customer services and operational management of software companies with a distributed workforce.
